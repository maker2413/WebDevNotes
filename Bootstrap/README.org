#+TITLE: Bootstrap

[[https://getbootstrap.com/][Bootstrap]] is a collection of well designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript libraries
that can be imported into any website and allows us to quickly build out
beautiful websites without having to write hundreds of lines of HTML, CSS, or
even JavaScript. It is still extremely important to learn the core concepts of
web design though before playing around with Bootstrap or you won't ever be much
of a developer.

To use Bootstrap one just has to simply go to the Bootstrap site and grab one of
their CDN links. They have one for the CSS they have a one for the JavaScript
they have. From there you if want to reference any of the CSS they have already
built out you can reference the documentation on their site and find classes
that they have available to use in your HTML. This saves you all the effort of
typing out CSS.

Included in this directory is also an example site built out with Bootstrap:
[[./index.html][here]].
