#+TITLE: HTML

HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents
that will be displayed in a web browser. Since I have learned HTML long ago
these notes really going to be nothing more than some skimming over examples I
have from long ago and some brief notes. If you are wanting to learn HTML I
recommend any number of online guides as HTML is just a way to write content
with some minor formatting.

CSS is a bit deeper of a topic as CSS is used to Style the text you have in your
HTML.
