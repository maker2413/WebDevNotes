#+TITLE: CSS

CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is used to describe how your HTML content should
be presented. The term cascading is used to note how the inheritance of
attributes is determined in CSS. By that I mean that if any parent attribute has
any CSS applied to it child attributes will automatically inherit them.

* CSS Properties
  CSS has too many properties to list here. I'm only going to document the
  common ones and the super useful ones:
  - ~align-content~: Sets the distribution of space between and around content
    items in a flexbox or grid
  - ~align-items~: Sets the alignment of items in a flexbox or grid
  - ~align-self~: overrides a grid or flex item's ~align-items~
  - ~background-color~: Controls the background color
    - Can be set a color by name, by hexadecimal, or by ~rgba~, which will allow
      us to set the opacity as well as the color

  - ~clear~: Controls whether an element must be moved below (cleared) floating
    elements
    - Over the years other methods have popped up to accomplish this at the
      parent level and have been dubbed "clearfix"

* Tips:
  - Box Model: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp
  - Targeting the =nth= child of an element:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child
  - Targeting specific attributes:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors
  - Form elements do not inherit font family settings from parent attributes.
  - Custom fonts can be added to your website with ~@font-face~:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face
  - Gradients can be created with:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient
  - When making a site work on devices of all sizes it is important to set
    ~viewport~: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp
  - The ~@media~ rule can be used to set CSS rules that only apply under certain
    requirements: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/atrule_media.php
  - A common design pattern in web development is the 12 column grid:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Realizing_common_layouts_using_grids
  - Common viewport size abbreviations are as follows:
    - ~xs~: Extra small (Smartphones)
    - ~sm~: Small (Tablets)
    - ~md~: Medium (Laptop or medium monitor)
    - ~lg~: Large (Desktop large monitor)
  - Flexbox is a modern way to efficiently lay out, align, and distribute space
    among items in a container:
    https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
  - ~fr~ is a size measurement in CSS and it stands for fractional unit:
    https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-grid-layout-fr-unit
  - ~minmax()~: is a function that defines a size range greater than or equal to
    ~min~ and less than or equal to ~max~:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/minmax
  - Both FireFox and Chromium based browsers allow you to view a wire frame of a
    CSS grid using the developer tools:
    https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/grid
  - It can be hard to remember the difference between ~align~ and ~justify~ when
    working with grids or flexbox. To make it easier you can think of word
    document editing software. In Word or Google sheets you can align text left,
    right, or center. You can also justify text, which will align the text
    squarely in center with no margins on the left or right of the text
  - ~repeat()~ is a CSS function that represents a repeated fragment of the
    track list allowing a large number of columns or rows that exhibit a
    recurring pattern to be written in a more compact form:
