#+TITLE: Slide Show

In this directory there are two example websites included. The first one is an
example website included that uses CSS and JQuery to make a slide show of images
and to add a menu button to reveal elements on small displays. The second one
creates a pop out image modal using JQuery. In the modern day it would be more
common to use [[https://getbootstrap.com/][bootstrap]] to accomplish this.

Since I have notes on JavaScript in a separate [[https://github.com/maker2413/JavaScriptNotes][repository]] I didn't know where I
should put these websites in this repository since they don't really relate to
CSS and doesn't actually get into JavaScript since they are just using JQuery
and downloaded JavaScript libraries. Therefore I'm just going to let these sites
live here so they can still be referenced.
